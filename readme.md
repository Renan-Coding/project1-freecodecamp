# Project Title: Mean, Variance, and Standard Deviation Calculator

## Description
This project is a Python-based tool that calculates the mean, variance, and standard deviation from a 3x3 matrix. It is designed as part of the Python curriculum for freeCodeCamp and serves as a hands-on exercise in statistical analysis using Numpy.

## Files
`main.py`: Main script that runs the program.

`mean_var_std.py`: Contains the calculate() function that computes the mean, variance, and standard deviation for rows, columns, and the flattened matrix.

`test_module.py`: Test module to verify the correctness of the calculations.

## Functionality
The calculate() function accepts a list of 9 numbers as input, reshapes it into a 3x3 matrix, and returns a dictionary containing the following statistics:

`Mean`: Calculated for rows, columns, and the flattened matrix.

`Variance`: Calculated for rows, columns, and the flattened matrix.

`Standard Deviation`: Calculated for rows, columns, and the flattened matrix.
